In this assignment, you will build a joke app. The two concepts you will practice are auto layout again and tabbars/segues.
Screen Size

Just like in SimpleCalc2, you will continue to use auto layout to scale the application to different device sizes.
Application should support portrait as well as landscape mode.
UI

When the user opens the application, there should be a TabBar at the bottom with three categories such as good, punny, and dad jokes. Feel free to make your own categories, just make sure to change the category name in the TabBar.
For each category, the user should see a simple centered label containing the question.
A "Next" button in the lower right corner should "flip" to reveal a simple centered label containing the punchline.
Error-Handling/App Crashing

In the previous calculator assignments, I was lenient on apps that crashed because we didn't specify what cases and operation combinations I would test. For this assignment, I think it's pretty straightforward that cases I will be testing are tapping through questions and switching between categories.
If the app crashes at any point while I'm testing, the assignment will receive a 0. This is not meant to be a scare tactic since this shouldn't be too difficult.
Extra Credit

1 pt if we LOL, 2 pts if we ROFL.
2 pts for a knock knock joke. Put in an animation that requires four "flips".
1 pt for replacing a question or punchline with an image (UIImage) instead of a label.
Technicalities

Some people haven't heard about the #homework_questions channel on Slack. This is the best place to post questions and I'll answer them as soon as I can!
